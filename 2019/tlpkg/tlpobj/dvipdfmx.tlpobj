shortdesc An extended version of dvipdfm
longdesc Dvipdfmx (formerly dvipdfm-cjk) is a development of dvipdfm
longdesc created to support multi-byte character encodings and large
longdesc character sets for East Asian languages. Dvipdfmx, if "called"
longdesc with the name dvipdfm, operates in a "dvipdfm compatibility"
longdesc mode, so that users of the both packages need only keep one
longdesc executable. A secondary design goal is to support as many "PDF"
longdesc features as does pdfTeX. The current version of the package is
longdesc no longer maintained on CTAN as a separate entity; development
longdesc now takes place within the TeX Live framework, and it is no
longdesc longer available as a separate package. For download, support,
longdesc and other information, please see TeX Live.
