shortdesc High-level LaTeX3 concepts
longdesc This collection contains implementations for aspects of the
longdesc LaTeX3 kernel, dealing with higher-level ideas such as the
longdesc Designer Interface. The packages here are considered broadly
longdesc stable (The LaTeX3 Project does not expect the interfaces to
longdesc alter radically). These packages are built on LaTeX2e
longdesc conventions at the interface level, and so may not migrate in
longdesc the current form to a stand-alone LaTeX3 format. Packages
longdesc provided: xparse, which provides a high-level interface for
longdesc declaring document commands xfp, an expandable IEEE 754 FPU for
longdesc LaTeX l3keys2e, which makes the facilities of the kernel module
longdesc l3keys available for use by LaTeX 2e packages xtemplate, which
longdesc provides a means of defining generic functions using a
longdesc key-value syntax xfrac, which provides flexible split-level
longdesc fractions
